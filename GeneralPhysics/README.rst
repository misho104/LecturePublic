Lecture Public / General Physics
================================

Public materials for `General Physics <https://www2.nsysu.edu.tw/iwamoto/gp1.html>`_, targeted for first-year undergraduate students in engineering and physics.


Contents
--------

- Derivative Boot Camp

  Intended for self-study before the course starts.
  Separated to three steps:

  - ``basic`` contains *minimal* problems to be studied before the course.
  - ``true`` includes more problems for motivated students.
  - ``extra`` introduces Napier's constant and natural logarithm.

- Vector Boot Camp

  Most of the concepts they need during General Physics 1 and 2 are introduced.

- (Integral Boot Camp: to be written?)
